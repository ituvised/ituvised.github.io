  abstract = {In the past few years, large high-resolution displays (LHRDs) have attracted considerable attention from researchers, industries, and application areas that increasingly rely on data-driven decision-making. An up-to-date survey on the use of LHRDs for interactive data visualization seems warranted to summarize how new solutions meet the characteristics and requirements of LHRDs and take advantage of their unique benefits. In this survey, we start by defining LHRDs and outlining the consequence of LHRD environments on interactive visualizations in terms of more pixels, space, users, and devices. Then, we review related literature along the four axes of visualization, interaction, evaluation studies, and applications. With these four axes, our survey provides a unique perspective and covers a broad range of aspects being relevant when developing interactive visual data analysis solutions for LHRDs. We conclude this survey by reflecting on a number of opportunities for future research to help the community take up the still open challenges of interactive visualization on LHRDs.}

  title = {{Me-ifestos for Visualization Empowerment in Teaching (and Learning?)}},
  abstract = {One sunny June afternoon in a remote castle deep in Saarland, a group of visualization researchers of many stripes — from different countries, disciplines and generations — came together to discuss  teaching and learning for empowerment in visualization. Our first order of business in Saarland was to develop a shared vision: a manifesto of sorts that would guide us towards strategies to broaden data visualization skills, make them more common and accessible, and enable this empowerment. That exercise failed. Instead of creating one common manifesto (who are we to do that, anyway?), we took a different, more personal approach. We found things we liked and things we didn’t: inspiration and counter-inspiration, we crafted individual value and commitment statements ("me-ifestos"), we shared these with each other and reflected on them. The process of writing these commitment statements was illuminating and motivating. It was a positive experience with such visceral effects that we want to share the feeling with the visualization community. And so we offer a collection of "me-ifesto" excerpts from the authors and a call to action: we invite you to craft and divulge your own me-ifesto.},

  Abstract = {&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) is widely used by clinical coders worldwide for clinical coding morbidity data into administrative health databases. Accordingly, hospital data quality largely depends on the coders' skills acquired during ICD training, which varies greatly across countries.&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;To characterise the current landscape of international ICD clinical coding training.&lt;h4&gt;Method&lt;/h4&gt;An online questionnaire was created to survey the 194 World Health Organization (WHO) member countries. Questions focused on the training provided to clinical coding professionals. The survey was distributed to potential participants who met specific criteria, and to organisations specialised in the topic, such as WHO Collaborating Centres, to be forwarded to their representatives. Responses were analysed using descriptive statistics.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Data from 47 respondents from 26 countries revealed disparities in all inquired topics. However, most participants reported clinical coders as the primary person assigning ICD codes. Although training was available in all countries, some did not mandate training qualifications, and those that did differed in type and duration of training, with college or university degree being most common. Clinical coding certificates most frequently entailed passing a certification exam. Most countries offered continuing training opportunities, and provided a range of support resources for clinical coders.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;Variability in clinical coder training could affect data collection worldwide, thus potentially hindering international comparability of health data.&lt;h4&gt;Implications&lt;/h4&gt;These findings could encourage countries to improve their resources and training programs available for clinical coders and will ultimately be valuable to the WHO for the standardisation of ICD training.},

    abstract = {Background Measurement of care quality and safety mainly relies on abstracted administrative data. However, it is well studied that administrative data-based adverse event (AE) detection methods are suboptimal due to lack of clinical information. Electronic medical records (EMR) have been widely implemented and contain detailed and comprehensive information regarding all aspects of patient care, offering a valuable complement to administrative data. Harnessing the rich clinical data in EMRs offers a unique opportunity to improve detection, identify possible risk factors of AE and enhance surveillance. However, the methodological tools for detection of AEs within EMR need to be developed and validated. The objectives of this study are to develop EMR-based AE algorithms from hospital EMR data and assess AE algorithm’s validity in Canadian EMR data.   Methods Patient EMR structured and text data from acute care hospitals in Calgary, Alberta, Canada will be linked with discharge abstract data (DAD) between 2010 and 2020 (n~1.5 million). AE algorithms development. First, a comprehensive list of AEs will be generated through a systematic literature review and expert recommendations. Second, these AEs will be mapped to EMR free texts using Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies. Finally, an expert panel will assess the clinical relevance of the developed NLP algorithms. AE algorithms validation: We will test the newly developed AE algorithms on 10,000 randomly selected EMRs between 2010 to 2020 from Calgary, Alberta. Trained reviewers will review the selected 10,000 EMR charts to identify AEs that had occurred during hospitalization. Performance indicators (e.g., sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, F1 score, etc.) of the developed AE algorithms will be assessed using chart review data as the reference standard.   Discussion The results of this project can be widely implemented in EMR based healthcare system to accurately and timely detect in-hospital AEs.},

  abstract={Data visualization can be powerful in enabling us to make sense of complex data. Expressive data representation – where individuals have control over the nature of the output – is hard to incorporate into existing frameworks and techniques for visualization. The power of informal, rough, expressive sketches in working out ideas is well documented. This points to an opportunity to better understand how expressivity can exist in data visualization creation. We explore the expressive potential of Data Painting through a study aimed at improving our understanding of what people need and make use of in creating novel examples of data expression. Participants use exact measures of paint for data-mapping and then explore the expressive possibilities of free-form data representation. Our intentions are to improve our understanding of expressivity in data visualization; to raise questions as to the creation and use of non-traditional data visualizations; and to suggest directions for expressivity in visualization.},

  abstract={We take the well-established use of physical scale models in architecture and identify new opportunities for using them to interactively visualize and examine multiple streams of geospatial data. Overlaying, comparing, or integrating visualizations of complementary data sets in the same physical space is often challenging given the constraints of various data types and the limited design space of possible visual encodings. Our vision of "simultaneous worlds" uses physical models as a substrate upon which visualizations of multiple data streams can be dynamically and concurrently integrated. To explore the potential of this concept, we created three design explorations that use an illuminated campus model to integrate visualizations about building energy use, climate, and movement paths on a university campus. We use a research through design approach, documenting how our interdisciplinary collaborations with domain experts, students, and architects informed our designs. Based on our observations, we characterize the benefits of models for 1) situating visualizations, 2) composing visualizations, and 3) manipulating and authoring visualizations. Our work highlights the potential of physical models to support embodied exploration of spatial and non-spatial visualizations through fluid interactions.},

  abstract={INTRODUCTION. The unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic unveiled a strong need for advanced and informative surveillance tools. The Centre for Health Informatics (CHI) at the University of Calgary took action to develop a surveillance dashboard, which would facilitate the education of the public, and answer critical questions posed by local and national government. OBJECTIVES. The objective of this study was to create an interactive method of surveillance, or a “COVID-19 Tracker” for Canadian use. The Tracker offers user-friendly graphics characterizing various aspects of the current pandemic (e.g. case count, testing, hospitalizations, and policy interventions). METHODS. Six publicly available data sources were used, and were selected based on the frequency of updates, accuracy and types of data, and data presentation. The datasets have different levels of granularity for different provinces, which limits the information that we are able to show. Additionally, some datasets have missing entries, for which the “last observation carried forward” method was used. The website was created and hosted online, with a backend server, which is updated on a daily basis. The Tracker development followed an iterative process, as new figures were added to meet the changing needs of policy-makers. RESULTS. The resulting Tracker is a dashboard that visualizes real-time data, along with policy interventions from various countries, via user-friendly graphs with a hover option that reveals detailed information. The interactive features allow the user to customize the figures by jurisdiction, country/region, and the type of data shown. Data is displayed at the national and provincial level, as well as by health regions. CONCLUSION. The COVID-19 Tracker offers real-time, detailed, and interactive visualizations that have the potential to shape crucial decision-making and inform Albertans and Canadians of the current pandemic.}

This design preserves most of the benefits of a constructive process while avoiding scalability issues by allowing designers to propagate individual mapping steps to all the elements of a visualization. We also discuss the perceived benefits of our approach and propose avenues for future research in this area.},

  author={Walny, Jagoda and Frisson, Christian and West, Mieka and Kosminsky, Doris and Knudsen, S{\o}ren and Carpendale, Sheelagh and Willett, Wesley},
  abstract={Complex data visualization design projects often entail collaboration between people with different visualization-related skills. For example, many teams include both designers who create new visualization designs and developers who implement the resulting visualization software. We identify gaps between data characterization tools, visualization design tools, and development platforms that pose challenges for designer-developer teams working to create new data visualizations. While it is common for commercial interaction design tools to support collaboration between designers and developers, creating data visualizations poses several unique challenges that are not supported by current tools. In particular, visualization designers must characterize and build an understanding of the underlying data, then specify layouts, data encodings, and other data-driven parameters that will be robust across many different data values. In larger teams, designers must also clearly communicate these mappings and their dependencies to developers, clients, and other collaborators. We report observations and reflections from five large multidisciplinary visualization design projects and highlight six data-specific visualization challenges for design specification and handoff. These challenges include adapting to changing data, anticipating edge cases in data, understanding technical challenges, articulating data-dependent interactions, communicating data mappings, and preserving the integrity of data mappings across iterations. Based on these observations, we identify opportunities for future tools for prototyping, testing, and communicating data-driven designs, which might contribute to more successful and collaborative data visualization design.},

The ICD system, in different versions, is globally used for coding morbidity and mortality statistics, however, coding practices vary across countries. Our survey includes questions about hospital data collection systems, use of features in ICD, and training of ICD coding specialists. Variations in ICD could hinder comparability and limit generalizability of observed findings. Our preliminary results establish the current state of ICD use and training internationally, and will ultimately be valuable to the World Health Organization to further research on how to improve ICD coding, and enhance international comparisons of health data. From a visualization and visual analytics perspective, the current differences in adoption and use of ICD poses challenges and opportunities. For example, when morbidity-data from two countries differ in their coding, can we still compare data from these countries, and if so, then under which circumstances? We discuss how visualization and visual analytics might help in these situations.},

  journal={Information Design Journal},
  abstract={Data visualizations are often represented in public discourse as objective proof of facts. However, a visualization is only a single translation of reality, just like any other media, representation devices, or modes of representation. If we wish to encourage thoughtful, informed, and literate consumption of data visualizations, it is crucial that we consider why they are often presented and interpreted as objective. We reflect theoretically on data visualization as a system of representation historically anchored in science, rationalism, and notions of objectivity. It establishes itself within a lineage of conventions for visual representations which extends from the Renaissance to the present and includes perspective drawing, photography, cinema and television, as well as computer graphics. By examining our tendency to see credibility in data visualizations and grounding that predisposition in a historical context, we hope to encourage more critical and nuanced production and interpretation of data visualizations in the public discourse.},

  author={Huynh, Tina and Knudsen, S{\o}ren and Carpendale, Sheelagh},
  journal={In Posters of IEEE VIS 2018 (IEEE VIS)},
  abstract={Visualization systems with multiple views are often used to represent data from different perspectives. There are many advantages in doing so, such as providing a way for users to understand a dataset by revealing its various attributes in separate views and offering additional information that could be more useful than if it was just one graph. However, this can often make data seem complicated and overwhelming as each view remains independent. We present a visualization that utilizes multiple views as a means for interaction and unifying the different data dimensions of a multi-view system. This creates a cohesive visualization that displays different aspects of the data, in this case, hierarchical text data and numerical data. With this personal data visualization, we offer a potential solution for relating additional data structures through interaction while maintaining different data types shown and linking multiple views to form a larger connected graph.},

The changes in physical setup of very large and possibly multiple displays, potentially combined with smaller handheld displays that can be used for both input and display augmentation, in addition to new input technologies, challenges much of current practice in multiple views. In particular: coordination techniques need to be extended for multiple views across multiple displays; we may need to re-examine task and interaction behaviour in new environments; collaboration challenges may come to the fore due to the potential for immersive technologies to provide more space for team analytics; and reconsidering our formalisms in light of these changes may prove fruitful.},

Our approach is useful in exploring new domains and avenues for visualization, and contrasts other visualization work, which typically operate under the assumption that data has already been collected, and is ready to be visualized. We argue that it is sensible to understand data requirements and evaluate the potential value of visualization before devising means of automatic data collection. We base our exploration on three cases selected to span a range of factors, such as the role of the person doing the data collection and the type of instrumentation used. The three cases relate to visualizing sports, construction, and cooking domain data, and use primarily time-domain data and visualizations. For each case, we briefly describe the design case and problem, the manner in which we collected data, and the findings obtained from evaluations. Afterwards, we describe four factors of our data collection approach, and discuss potential outcomes from it.},

  abstract={In this paper, we explore the potential of using visual representations to support people in managing, organizing, and understanding relations between multiple visualization views. Multiple views can help people understand different facets of data and data processing, and are a crucial part of data analysis particularly when it is done collaboratively. Both the growing use of multiple views and the increasing display sizes have amplified the need to explore how to better help people to understand the relations between many views. To improve our understanding of how to visualize view relations, we invited visualization and interaction designers to critique and sketch representations of view relations. The participants provided design critiques, and sketched their own relation representations. Our findings expand the range and palette of ways of visually linking visualization views and suggest new directions for designing view relation representations to better support analysis with multiple views.},

  abstract={This paper describes a study that sought to understand elite soccer teenagers’ use of information visualizations to learn about their own sports performance, how this might motivate them to change behavior, and thus potentially improve their own performance. We specifically investigate how information visualizations support the players’ data comprehension, and how their level of comprehension might depend on factors such as their general literacy, visualization literacy and maturity. We show unsurprisingly that elite soccer teenagers are able to use information visualizations to gain new information about their performance. Based on our investigation, we define a classification of the level of data comprehension. Secondly, we demonstrate a method which allows visualization researchers and practitioners to design and evaluate visualization concepts based on real data over a short time-span. Finally, we argue that designers of personal information visualizations need to consider the range of visualization literacies that are to be expected in many target populations. Our lessons provide new insights in peoples’ use of visualizations and more broadly in visualization literacy. From these insights, we discuss implications for design of visualizations that consider peoples’ level of visualization literacy.},

We explore how to use such spatial relations among people and visualizations (i.e., proxemics) to drive interaction with visualizations, focusing here on the spatial relations between a single user and visualizations on a large display. We implement interaction techniques that zoom and pan, query and relate, and adapt visualizations based on tracking of users' position in relation to a large high-resolution display. Alternative prototypes are tested in three user studies and compared with baseline conditions that use a mouse. Our aim is to gain empirical data on the usefulness of a range of design possibilities and to generate more ideas. Among other things, the results show promise for changing zoom level or visual representation with the user's physical distance to a large display. We discuss possible benefits and potential issues to avoid when designing information visualizations that use proxemics.},

Analysts were asked to walk through recent tasks using actual data on a large whiteboard, imagining it to be a large display. From the resulting comments and a video analysis of behavior in the workshops, we generate ideas for new interaction techniques for large displays.

  abstract={The traditional graphical user interface employing windows, icons, menus and pointers show weaknesses in face to face collaboration, and has done so during its lifetime. The hype of multi-touch technology marks a new and promising path for treading new lands in computer use. Tangible computing is another less hyped futuristic interaction method on the verge to mass media coverage. Discovering the differences and similarities of these two methods of interaction in face to face collaboration applications is not one possible, but needed, in order to understand, not just what to design, but how to design it.
In the works, collaboration performance of the two interaction methods is held up in the light, fir everybody to perceive and evaluate the differences. It is shown, that the two interaction methods are rather collaborators than contestants – they augment each other well, showing strengths, where the other show weaknesses.
It is described how a tabletop system, which supports both methods of interaction is designed, built and used for subsequent evaluations. The possibilities of a system, utilizing these interaction methods, in design of signal processing systems in a research group, is proposed, analyzed, and evaluated — although never fully implemented
The major conclusion stemming from this work is, that that combination of multi-touch interaction and tangible computing should be experienced, in order to fully understand their possibilities. The single-most important problem facing this conclusion is, that these interaction systems don’t exist commercially yet.},
